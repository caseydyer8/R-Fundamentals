We can do math with R and it is pretty cool. We will assign some numbers to variables and then do some simple math with R.

First let's start by assiging a value to a variable. Here we are giving quarter_1_sales the value 35657.98. See this below:

quarter_1_sales <- 35657.98

Next, let's add a second value to another variable. Here we are giving quarter_2_sales the value 43810.55. See this below: 

quarter_2_sales <- 43810.55

Now let's do some math. We want to create another variable midyear_sales and we want to add quarter_1_sales to quarter_2_sales to do so. See below for how to do this: 

midyear_sales <- quarter_1_sales + quarter_2_sales

Then we want to create another variable called yearend_sales and multiply midyear_sales by two to get that value. We will do this with this code: 

yearend_sales <- midyear_sales * 2

Now if we highlight all of this code and run it, R will give us all of our results and they are:

# our first calculations
> quarter_1_sales <- 35657.98
> quarter_2_sales <- 43810.55
> midyear_sales <- quarter_1_sales + quarter_2_sales
> midyear_sales
[1] 79468.53

> yearend_sales <- midyear_sales * 2
> yearend_sales
[1] 158937.1
